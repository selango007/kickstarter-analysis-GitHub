# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The overview of this project is to analyze the Theatre Performance.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help Louise to:
 - Analyze the Outcomes of the Theatre project by Launch Date and
 - Analyze the Outcome of the Plays under Theatre Category by Goals
 
 
## Analysis and Challenges
To perform the Theatre's analysis, 2 charts were created.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the Outcome by Launch Date chart, it is found that:
 - May is the most successful month for theatres followed by June.
 - Also in these months more Theatres were launched.
 - More the theatres launched, better the success rate.
 - Even though the failures in Summer months are almost similar to October, the failure rate is very high in October since the number of successful outcomes are very less in October. Hence October is not a very good month for theatre launches.

 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on the Outcomes Based on Goals:
 - Plays with the goal "Less Than 1000" performs the best followed by the plays with goal "in the Range 1000 to 4999".
 - Plays with the goal "More than 50000" performs the worst since the failure rate is 87.5% compared to success rate of just 12.5%
 - Even though the plays with goal 45000 to 49999 has a 100% failure rate, there was only 1 play in this range, hence we can't really take this into acount.However if we consider the overall plays with goals more than 25000 with the exception of 35000 to 39000 the plays didn't really perform well.

 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
1. A possible challenge could be all amount are displayed with $ symbol even though we have a separate currency column. This could lead to a question if the amount should be converted to respective currency.
2. The data set has good amount of data for the years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. Rest of the years doesn't really have complete data. More the data, better the analysis.
 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Overall observation is Summer months are better for theatre launch and Autumn or Winter months are not better months for theatre launch.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Have more number of plays with less goal range so that we achieve much better success rate.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data set has good amount of data for the years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. Rest of the years doesn't really have complete data. More the data, better the analysis.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A table to filter by Name to analyse the outcome can be even more effective in order to determine which theatres shall be launched more and when in order to improve the success rate.
